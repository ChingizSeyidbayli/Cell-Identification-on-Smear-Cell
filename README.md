# Cell-Identification-on-Smear-Cell

Detection of smear cells is an important factor. This is because segmentation is required to classify diseased and healthy cells. Conventional image processing methods or deep neural networks can be used for segmentation.

In this study, the detection of cells was carried out using the OpenCV library. The cell image used in the application is taken from the Herlev dataset, which is the most widely used Smear dataset. By changing the parameter values in the code, it can be detected automatically in different visuals.
